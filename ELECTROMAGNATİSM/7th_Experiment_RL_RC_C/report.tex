% Introduction 
\section{Introduction}
This section introduces the concepts of RL and RC circuits. The primary aim is to investigate the behavior of these circuits under different conditions. Understanding these circuits is critical in analyzing the transient and steady-state responses in electrical systems.

% Theoretical Background
\section{Theoretical Background}
In this section introduces the equations used in the analysis of RL and RC circuits, as provided in the lab manual \cite{lab_manual}.

\subsection{RL Circuit}
An RL circuit consists of a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) connected in series or parallel. The behavior of the circuit is governed by the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    V(t) = L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + IR \label{eq:rl_voltage}
\end{equation}
where \(V(t)\) is the voltage, \(I(t)\) is the current, \(L\) is the inductance, and \(R\) is the resistance.

The impedance \(Z\) of the RL circuit is given by:
\begin{equation}
    Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2} \label{eq:rl_impedance}
\end{equation}
where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the AC source.

The phase angle \(\phi\) between the voltage and the current is:
\begin{equation}
    \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}\right) \label{eq:rl_phase}
\end{equation}

\subsection{RC Circuit}
An RC circuit consists of a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) connected in series or parallel. The behavior of the circuit is governed by the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
    V(t) = IR + \frac{1}{C} \int I(t) dt \label{eq:rc_voltage}
\end{equation}
where \(V(t)\) is the voltage, \(I(t)\) is the current, \(R\) is the resistance, and \(C\) is the capacitance.

The impedance \(Z\) of the RC circuit is given by:
\begin{equation}
    Z = \sqrt{R^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\omega C}\right)^2} \label{eq:rc_impedance}
\end{equation}

The phase angle \(\phi_{RC}\) between the voltage and the current is:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_{RC} = \arctan\left(-\frac{1}{\omega RC}\right) \label{eq:rc_phase}
\end{equation}

These equations form the basis for the calculations performed in the experiment, as detailed in the Jupyter notebook `Calculations.ipynb`. The notebook includes the computation of various physical quantities such as impedance, phase angle, and component values for both RL and RC circuits.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
The phasor diagrams demonstrate the phase relationships between voltage and current in the RL and RC circuits. The RL circuit shows a phase shift where the current lags the voltage, while the RC circuit shows a phase shift where the current leads the voltage. These observations align with theoretical predictions.

In the RL circuit, the inductor causes the current to lag behind the voltage due to the inductive reactance, which increases with frequency. This behavior is evident from the phase angle \(\phi\) calculated in the results. The impedance of the RL circuit also increases with frequency, as shown by the impedance equation.

Conversely, in the RC circuit, the capacitor causes the current to lead the voltage due to the capacitive reactance, which decreases with frequency. The negative phase angle \(\phi_{RC}\) confirms this leading behavior. The impedance of the RC circuit decreases with increasing frequency, as indicated by the impedance equation.

The experimental results closely match the theoretical calculations, validating the accuracy of the experimental setup and measurement techniques. The variations in resistance and capacitance provided a comprehensive understanding of the circuit behavior under different conditions.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
This experiment highlights the principles of RL and RC circuits and demonstrates their behavior under different conditions. The experimental results confirm the theoretical relationships between resistance, inductance, capacitance, and circuit behavior.

The key findings include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The RL circuit exhibits a phase shift where the current lags the voltage, with impedance increasing with frequency.
    \item The RC circuit shows a phase shift where the current leads the voltage, with impedance decreasing with frequency.
    \item The experimental data aligns well with theoretical predictions, validating the experimental methods used.
\end{itemize}

Understanding the behavior of RL and RC circuits is crucial for analyzing and designing electrical systems, particularly in applications involving signal processing and AC circuit analysis. The insights gained from this experiment provide a solid foundation for further studies in electrical engineering and related fields.
