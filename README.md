# Physics Experiments and Analysis

This repository is created by a student and features a collection of physics experiments, data analysis projects, and simulations. Its purpose is to enhance the understanding of key physics and mathematics concepts through hands-on experimentation and detailed analysis. The projects include comprehensive reports, experimental setups, and analytical models covering topics such as gravitational acceleration, elastic extension, and uniformly accelerating motion.

Purpose: The main objective of this repository is to provide a complete learning environment, including experimental setups, data analysis tools, and scripts. By sharing these resources, others can reproduce the experiments, build upon the models, and further explore the physics underlying these concepts.

> Disclaimer: This repository was created by a student and may contain errors or inaccuracies. It is intended for learning purposes, and feedback or corrections are always welcome.

## Features

- Detailed reports on physics experiments with clear methodologies.
- Data analysis using Python for various experiments, including linear/polonomial regression and dimensional analysis.
- Visualizations created with Matplotlib to illustrate experimental results and theoretical predictions.
- Comprehensive documentation and LaTeX formatting for academic reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **LaTeX**: Typesetting system used for formatting reports and documents.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **LLMs**: Large language models and AI tools were used to enhance the readability and clarity of the reports globally.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibeuler/LAB-Reports.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LAB-Reports
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

To run a specific analysis or experiment, navigate to the appropriate directory and open the Jupyter Notebooks. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the desired notebook (`.ipynb` file) for the experiment or analysis you want to explore.

3. Once the notebook is open, run the cells to execute the analysis and visualize the results.
